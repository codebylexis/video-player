  **Design Movement**: Cyberpunk / High-Tech Industrial
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Functionality**: Exposed structural elements, grid lines, and technical data overlays.
  2. **High Contrast**: Deep blacks, neon accents, and sharp edges.
  3. **Immersive Control**: Controls feel like a cockpit or command terminal.
  4. **Glitch & Distortion**: Subtle digital artifacts in transitions and hover states.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: #050505 (Void Black) - To make the video content pop with zero distraction.
  - **Primary Accent**: #00ff9d (Neon Mint) - For active states, progress bars, and critical indicators. High visibility against black.
  - **Secondary Accent**: #ff0055 (Cyber Red) - For recording/alert states or destructive actions.
  - **UI Elements**: #1a1a1a (Dark Gunmetal) - For panels and control backgrounds.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **HUD Overlay**: Controls float over the video content or snap to the edges like a Heads-Up Display.
  - **Modular Panels**: Draggable, semi-transparent panels for playlists or settings, mimicking OS windows.
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Controls grouped by function rather than centered symmetry (e.g., playback left, tools right).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Scanlines**: Faint horizontal lines overlaying the UI (not the video) to give a monitor aesthetic.
  - **Monospaced Data**: Timecodes and metadata displayed in a technical monospace font with blinking cursors.
  - **Angled Corners**: Buttons and containers have 45-degree cut corners instead of rounded ones.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons have a "press" animation that feels mechanical.
  - **Instant Response**: Zero lag, sharp transitions.
  - **Keyboard First**: Heavy emphasis on hotkeys, with visual cues when keys are pressed.

  **Animation**:
  - **Glitch Reveal**: Elements flicker into existence.
  - **Slide & Snap**: Panels slide in quickly and snap into place with a "thud" easing.
  - **Pulse**: Active elements pulse slowly like a heartbeat.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: 'Orbitron' or 'Rajdhani' - Futuristic, squared-off sans-serif for headers.
  - **Data/Body**: 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Share Tech Mono' - Highly legible, technical feel for timecodes and settings.

  **Design Movement**: Neumorphism / Soft UI (Modernized)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Tactile Softness**: Elements appear to be extruded from the background, mimicking physical buttons.
  2. **Light & Shadow**: Heavy use of highlights and shadows to define shape and depth.
  3. **Minimalist Zen**: Distraction-free viewing experience with controls that fade away when not in use.
  4. **Fluidity**: Smooth, organic curves and transitions.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: #e0e5ec (Light Grey-Blue) or #2b2d33 (Dark Soft Grey) - Low contrast to reduce eye strain.
  - **Shadows**: Darker and lighter variations of the background color to create the extruded effect.
  - **Accent**: #6c5ce7 (Soft Purple) or #0984e3 (Calm Blue) - Used sparingly for active states (play button, progress bar).

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Island**: The control bar is a floating capsule at the bottom, detached from the edges.
  - **Centered Focus**: Playback controls are centrally aligned for balance and ease of access.
  - **Hidden Complexity**: Advanced settings are tucked away in drawers or modals to keep the main view clean.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Soft Shapes**: Everything is rounded (buttons, containers, sliders).
  - **Inner Shadows**: Used for pressed states to make buttons look like they are pushed *into* the surface.
  - **Frosted Glass**: Subtle blur effects on overlays (volume, settings) to maintain context.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Physicality**: Buttons feel like they have weight and resistance.
  - **Hover Lift**: Elements gently lift up (shadows expand) when hovered.
  - **Smooth Scrubbing**: The timeline slider moves with a magnetic, fluid feel.

  **Animation**:
  - **Morphing**: Icons morph into each other (Play -> Pause).
  - **Fade & Scale**: Controls fade out and scale down slightly when inactive.
  - **Elasticity**: Bouncy easing on interactions to feel organic.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Primary**: 'Nunito' or 'Quicksand' - Rounded sans-serif to match the soft UI shapes.
  - **Secondary**: 'Inter' - Clean and neutral for smaller text and labels.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Cinematic Adaptation)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Systems**: Rigorous adherence to a mathematical grid for layout.
  2. **Objective Photography**: The video content is the hero; the UI is the frame.
  3. **Typography as Image**: Large, bold type used for impact and structure.
  4. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic layouts that create tension and interest.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: #ffffff (Stark White) or #000000 (True Black) - High contrast canvas.
  - **Primary**: #ff3b30 (Cinema Red) - Classic color for recording/playback, draws immediate attention.
  - **Secondary**: #007aff (Studio Blue) - For selection and information.
  - **Neutral**: #8e8e93 (Mid Grey) - For secondary controls and inactive states.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Split Screen**: Metadata and playlist on one side, video on the other (in non-fullscreen).
  - **Overlay Typography**: Large title overlays that slide away on play.
  - **Corner Anchors**: Controls anchored to corners rather than centered, leaving the view unobstructed.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Bold Lines**: Thick dividers and borders to separate content areas.
  - **Huge Type**: Chapter titles or timecodes displayed in massive font sizes when scrubbing.
  - **Geometric Icons**: Simple, solid geometric shapes for icons (triangle for play, square for stop).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Cut**: Transitions are instant cuts, mimicking film editing.
  - **Hover Reveal**: Information is hidden until hovered, keeping the interface clean.
  - **Precise Control**: Scrubbing is frame-accurate with a filmstrip preview.

  **Animation**:
  - **Kinetic Type**: Text slides and crops in interesting ways.
  - **Curtain Reveal**: Panels slide away like curtains.
  - **Hard Cuts**: No fades, just instant state changes for a snappy feel.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Primary**: 'Helvetica Now' or 'Akzidenz-Grotesk' - The quintessential Swiss fonts. Neutral, objective, bold.
  - **Secondary**: 'Roboto Mono' - For technical details like frame count or bitrate.
